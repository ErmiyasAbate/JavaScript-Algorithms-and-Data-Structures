12. Length of the String
13. Single Character in the String
14. String Immutability
15. JavaScript Creating Array (Storing multiple values in a single variable)
16. Nested JavaScript Array (Multi-Dimensional Array)
17. Accessing JavaScript Arrays
18. Modifying Array Data With Indexes
19. Accessing and Modifying Multi-dimensional Arrays
20. Manipulate Arrays With push() Method
